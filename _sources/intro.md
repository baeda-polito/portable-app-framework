## Main Features

Here are just a few of the things that `portable-app-framework` does.

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

You can use the CLI to to create, manage and update applications

positional arguments:
  {new,update}
    new         Create a new application folder from template.
    update      Update README of an application.

options:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit

```

### Application class

A python class that helps to create a portable application. Once you created a new application in your project you can
set up and run an application with the following lines of code

```python
import pandas as pd
import brickschema
from portable_app_framework import Application

app = Application(
    metadata=brickschema.Graph(),
    app_name='app_name'
)
qualify_result = app.qualify()  # True/False
fetch_result = app.fetch()  # Dict of mapped variables
df = pd.DataFrame()  # get df according to your logic 
df_clean = app.clean(df)
final_result = app.analyze(df_clean)
```

## Cite

Work on ``portable-app-framework`` started in 2021 as an internal project at BAEDA Lab to deploy energy management and
information systems application in a most reliable way instead of solving implementation issues from scratch every time.
We found that the framework enabled faster deployment of such solutions thanks to the builtin methods that allowed the
analyst to skip ripetitive data integration tasks. Moreover allowed non analyst expert of metadata schema to exploit the
power of such tools. So we decided to create this package to share our experience with the scientific community and not
only.
